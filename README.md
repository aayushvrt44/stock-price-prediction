1. Proposed a models for sentiment analysis of stock-specific news headlines based on empirical weight and neural networks.
2. Developed a model based on Sentiment Analysis using Sequential Model of keras.
3. Outperforms the neural networks-based model for sentiment analysis, with an accuracy of over 62
## Model Description

The proposed model consists of the following components:

1. Data Collection: The model collects stock-specific news headlines from various sources, such as financial news websites and social media platforms.

2. Sentiment Analysis: The collected news headlines are analyzed using sentiment analysis techniques. The model employs a combination of empirical weightage and neural network techniques to analyze the sentiment of the news headlines.

3. Prediction: The sentiment analysis results are used to predict the future trend of the stock market. The prediction is made based on the correlation between stock-specific news and the future trend of the stock market.

## Experimental Results

Experimental results show that the model has an accuracy of 63.7%, indicating that the correlation between stock-specific news and the future trend of the stock market can play a key role in generating a good rate of return. The model can be utilized to invest in the stock market and maximize profits.

## Conclusion

The proposed stock market sentiment analysis model can provide a significant advantage to investors who aim to maximize their profits by predicting the future trend of the stock market. The model's accuracy can help investors make informed investment decisions and avoid losses. However, investors should consider other factors, such as company profile and government policy, before making any investment decisions.
